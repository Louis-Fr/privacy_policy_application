        collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province

                    whether we collect and use your personal information;
                    the categories of personal information that we collect;

                    Verification process
                    Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the
                    information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information
                    you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain
                    information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you
                    through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification
                    methods as the circumstances dictate.
                    We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent
                    possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
                    identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
                    verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as
                    we finish verifying you.

                    information.
                    You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an
                    authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the
                    CCPA.
                    You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we
